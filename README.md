I was given a website that had accessibility issues, It was my task to adhere to accessibility standards and make sure the web page followed a sematic structure.
I changed the HTML layout to adhere with the accessibility standards, changing alot of <div> to the correct eliments.
I i re-structured the CSS to alighn with the HTML and also consolidated the selectors and properties aswel as adding comments to the CSS.
I have commented all the CSS so i know what the CSS is doing should i have to go back to it.
I i fixed a broken link that would not connect to the given path.
I have attatched an image of how the website should look and i have included the link to the website.
